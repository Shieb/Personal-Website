                Hello! My name is Josh Ringling and I am a major in computer science. I am
                currently a senior at <a href = "https://stthomas.edu" target = blank> University
                of St. Thomas</a>. I hope to jump right into my feild and work as soon as I graduate
                this spring and hopefully come back to get my masters degree after a couple years of
                working.
            </p>
