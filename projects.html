                This is a line drawing project that I created for my Computer Graphics
                course at St. Thomas. The actual code for the project is still hosted on
                Github and a link can be found <a href = "https://shieb.github.io/cg-shapescurves/"
                target = blank> here</a>. The goal of this project was to draw various shapes using
                different amounts of lines. There is a slider to change the amount of lines used to
                draw the shape and a check box used to show the point data of each line drawn.

                The objective of this project was to solve a ciphered text. The text encrypted
                using a substitution cipher where each letter of the alphabet equals a random
                other letter of the alphabet. In order to solve this cipher, frequency analysis
                was conducted on the text to find the occurence of each letter. Using the
                frequency analysis and the most commonly used letters in the English language,
                I was able to determine that the most commonly occuring letter 
                <span style = "color:darkblue; font-weight: bold;">'a'</span> equals most
                common letter in the english alphabet <span style = "color:darkblue; font-weight: bold;">
                'e'</span>. Using this method, I was able to decipher
                enough of the text to make educated guesses on the rest of the text for words like 
                <span style = "color:darkblue; font-weight: bold;">'the' </span>and 
                <span style = "color:darkblue; font-weight: bold;">'and' </span>in order to solve the 
                substitution cipher.

                This is another line drawing project, but this time it is in 3D! The actual code for 
                the project is still hosted on Github and a link can be found 
                <a href = "https://shieb.github.io/cg-3dprojections/" target = blank> here</a>.
                This project had us construct 3D models and simulate motion with them. The camera
                can be moved around with the arrow keys. The hardest part of this project was fixing
                things so that lines couldn't be drawn behind the camera. For instance, when you would
                move the camera inside the sphere lines would try to connect randomly all over the screen
                because they would be being drawn behind the camera, but still shown on the view.
